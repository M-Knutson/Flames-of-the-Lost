## Description
Flames of the Lost is a classic 2D platformer. Play as a fire spirit trying to find his place in the world. Inspired by the likes of *Hollow Knight*, *Ori and the Blind Forest*, and *Mario*, I created this demo level to teach myself the basics of game development in Python. I grew so much in the making of it such as in my ability to track class interactivity, refining character movement (including simulating gravity), and generating player interaction with objects such as platforms and checkpoints.

While this is merely a short, one-level demo, I tried to develp the code in such a way as to be modifiable for future use and continued game development. For example, I created a generate_level_one function to create level one so that I could add on new levels in the future by simply creating more level generating functions similar to the first. In the future, I hope to be able to add on more levels and more game design such as implementing enemy characters and side-scrolling capabilities.

I created my own custom art for *FotL*, stored in the art folder. I used Piskel for the custom pixel art platforms, checkpoint, and character animation. The background I painted using Procreate. I wanted to capture the visual feeling of games like *Hollow Knight* and *Ori* while adhereing to the classic gameplay of the older *Mario* games.
